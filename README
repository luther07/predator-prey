Predator-prey simulation with Akka actors.

Per akka docs, ! means "fire-and-forget", asynchronously, also known as "tell".
Per akka docs, ? sends a message asynchronously, and returns a Future immediately. This Future represents a possible reply, also known as "ask".

We are using sbt to run the simulations. I have renamed the file to build.sbt.txt so that you can change it if you want to use sbt.

Tests are in src/test/scala.
Tests us primarily WordSpec and TestKit traits.
Tests currently fail when invoked from sbt, with error saying that I must invoke 'actor.start()' before trying to use TestActorRef.
We cannot figure out this error which doesn't allow the test actors to even start.
We do have 100% coverage of the atomic messages that are getting passed around.
We are just testing responses received from actors when a message is sent to the actor. We are just testing individually, in isolation.
