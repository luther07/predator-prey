I. How do we model Time?

  A. Idea 1 - Based on time elapsed since initial call to currentTimeMillis()

    1. World keeps the time. World gets currentTimeMillis() at the beginning. 
       When an actor sends a message asking for the time, the world responds
       with some representation of the ammount of time elapsed since the
       first call to currentTimeMillis().
    2. Actors store their own Date of Birth
    3. Actors store a rate that represents the increment of time it must wait
       between successive reproduction.
    4. Actor stores the time of its last reproduction.
    5. When actor gets the currentTime, it evaluates predicate: (Time > (LastReproductionTime + ReproductionIncrement))
       If true, then the actor reproduces. If false, do nothing.

II. Idea 2?
